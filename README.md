# **README Generator**  -  [![License: WTFPL](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-WTFPL-brightgreen.svg)](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/)
    
This homework assignment for 03/06/2021 is a node.js application that allows the user to input data on the command line. The user responses are then used to generate a README document for their project! I had a lot of fun with this assignment, and hope fellow peers will find it useful. 
<br>
<br>
You can find video demos of the app [here](https://github.com/xander-deanna/readme-generator/tree/main/Demo/mov) or you can checkout the [Demo](#Demo) portion of **this** README to view some demo gifs.

## Requirements
Please make sure you have [node installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). You'll also need to download the [npm inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), as this is a dependancy for the app to run. See ["Usage"](#Usage) below for more details.

## Usage
**README Generator** requires npm packages to run. Please make sure [node is installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) prior to cloning the repo. You can find instructions for installing node on the [node website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
* After you're sure node.js has been installed correctly, clone the [README Generator Repo](https://github.com/xander-deanna/readme-generator) locally onto your computer. Instructions on how to clone from Github can be found on [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
* Once the repo has been cloned, please navigate to the correct directory using your terminal or other command line application. 
* Type <code>npm init -y</code> into the command line, and hit <kbd>enter</kbd>.
* Next type <code>npm install inquirer</code> into the command line, and hit <kbd>enter</kbd> to [install inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).
* After inquirer has been installed, you can simply type <code>node index.js</code> and hit <kbd>enter</kbd> to start the application.
* From here, just follow the prompts in the app to generate your README doc!
