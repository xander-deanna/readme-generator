# README Generator *Sample* README - [![License: WTFPL](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-WTFPL-brightgreen.svg)](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/)

    
This homework assignment for 03/06/2021 is a node.js application that allows the user to input data on the command line. The user responses are then used to generate a README document for their project! 
<br>

### You are currently reading a *sample* README generated using the project. **Your README file will replace this one if you decide to run the script!** 
<br>

If you are lost and are looking for *my* README for the app itself, [please click here](https://github.com/xander-deanna/readme-generator/blob/main/README.md).

## Requirements
Here is where you would list any requirements for your app. For example, you'll want to make sure to have [node installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for my application, and I would include those instructions in the README here.

## Usage
Some applications require other packages or installations to run. Here is where your would list any steps necessary to run your application. This section goes hand in hand with ["Requirements"](#Requirements).
<br>
* Here is a sample step.
* Sample step two!
* You can even get fancy with a bit of markdown syntax <code>like this</code> or like <kbd>this</kbd>, but I reconmend editing this after the file is already generated, *not* in the command line.
* Sample step four!
